The Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) project focuses on recognizing and classifying images based on visual features. CNNs extract patterns like edges, textures, and shapes through layered processing, making them ideal for tasks such as object detection, facial recognition, and medical imaging. This project demonstrates the power of deep learning in visual data analysis.
